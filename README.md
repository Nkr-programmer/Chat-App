# Chat-App
Chat AppThis Project is a Simple Chat application in which Email and Password is used for Authentication. In which anyone can send text messages to one who is logged in through the app .All data(authentication and Chats) are stored in FireBase DataBase. By this project I learned how crud operations work and data can be fetched from FireStore.
